# Fuzzy_Logic-Organic_Facies
Automated classification of organic facies using fuzzy logic.


This code implements an automated organic facies classification system based on fuzzy logic, utilizing total organic carbon (TOC), hydrogen index (HI), and oxygen index (OI) as input parameters. 

An example dataset, formatted as a comma-separated value (.csv) file, is provided in the "in" directory for illustrative purposes. 

A detailed explanation of the processing methodology is documented within the source Jupyter notebook (src).
